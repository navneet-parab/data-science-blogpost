## Installation
No extra necessary libraries should be required beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run fine with no issues using Python (versions 3.\*).

## Project Motivation
For this project, I wanted to study the trends of various AirBnb bookings throughout the year. I used the data for the year 2016 and attempted to answer the following questions:
1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? 
2. By how much do prices spike throughout the year?
3. Is there a general relation between the availability of listings and average price of listings?

The dataset for this project has been acquired from Kaggle.

## File Descriptions
There is one single jupyter notebook that process the dataset (csv file) and answers all the questions mentioned in the Project Motivation section. The notebook is self-explanatory and markdown cells have been used to guide through the thought process.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

## Licensing, Authors and Acknowledgments
Must give credit to Kaggle and AirBnb-Udacity for the data. The data can be found here. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
